     “I will kiss your wounds, balm your feet and soothe your aches, but expect no relief from your anguish, for it is only God who can bless atonement.” 
<br>
     Maria repeated this psalm to every orphan she took care of. Each passing day, frenzy consumed the minds of the children, as they spiraled out of control and eventually became the deranged townsfolk everyone feared the most of becoming. They were the most afflicted of them all. She herself found solace in these words. As she questioned her faith, these hackneyed words proved an effective method at silencing the blasphemy. Perhaps it is in nature that the vulnerable child seems so easy to exploit. 
<br>     
<br>“Will you ask what my name is?” The kid gargled in between breaths asking as he choked from the foam forming in his mouth. Maria frowned. She was visibly confused. As if she had never been asked this before. 
     <br>     “At the throne of God we will all be judged the same.” She replied, as she rolled the gauze around her wound. 
<br>     “Then, why am I dying? Do I deserve this?” 
Maria ignored the comment and asked for the child to turn over. How a child of presumably around eight years old was able to understand the concept of death and at such an early age was beyond Maria, but she was well used to those remarks by now. Her back, exposed, rested lacerated. 
<br>     “What has been on your mind recently?” Maria asked. The child stood in silence. Her eyes, restless. Maria thought it was best to leave her alone.

Five crusaders rounded the perimeter. They had taken three victims. Two of them were innocent. One guilty. Word spread that around a dozen men spoke behind the backs of the inquisition. Basically all of the town’s production was focused towards the aid of those ravaged by The Illness. Mostly, children.
<br>Maria woke up and found herself surrounded by severed heads. Inquisition came at noon. Many bandits, presumably folkstown, dressed up and butchered the torsos after midnight. In times of despair, many fell victims to the hysteria and succumbed to hunger, desperately eating whatever they could get their hands on. Carrion was no exception. When the inquisition heard about this, they sent crusaders again. Apparently they had already identified more than one culprit. Three women were hanged, and the rest of men, stoned to death
